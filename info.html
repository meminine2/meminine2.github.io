        <h2>Statement</h2>
        <p>I work primarily with moving image. Experiments with other formats, particularly painting, performance and writing, 
          extend from the central practice. Extreme close up, simulation, multiple image planes and shifting surfaces are common motifs 
          appearing in my work. Having previously explored interactive media and games, I have since settled on a more linear narrative approach 
          to digital media and its effects as a subject. My work examines the alienated condition of experience mediated by screens.<br/><br/>
          I use 3D animation software Blender to manipulate, collage and process found imagery. This imagery is often difficult to visually parse, 
          mundane in its subject matter, or lacking recognisable details. Motion can be incorporated into the scenes in an incongruous way, such as 
          motion tracking data from one video layered onto another. I like to represent a chaotic, subjective perspective in a computer simulated 
          environment associated with mathematical precision.<br/><br/>
          With a visual language that is rarely representative, I am also drawn to the sorts of patterns and compositions that appear in 
          religious iconography, textile design and blockbuster movie posters. <br/><br/>
          I am driven to understand and amplify the respective qualities of image and the written word, as well as the relationship between them. 
          I aim to make work that illuminates these qualities in a time when visual and linguistic literacy have a renewed importance. I choose
          moving image as my medium for its qualities of demanding and extracting of attention from the audience.
